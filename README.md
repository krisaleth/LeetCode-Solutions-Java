# LeetCode Journey - Java Solutions

This repository contains optimized solutions for various algorithmic problems on LeetCode, developed by a third-year Information Technology student.

## Personal Statistics
- Primary Language: Java
- Total Problems Solved: 43+
- Core Objectives: Strengthening logical thinking, mastering data structures, and optimizing algorithmic complexity (Time: O(n), O(log n); Space: O(n)).

## Problem-Solving Approach
Each solution is developed with a focus beyond just achieving an "Accepted" status:
1. Time Complexity: Minimizing execution time.
2. Space Complexity: Optimizing memory usage.
3. Code Quality: Writing clean, readable, and maintainable code.
